# RSA-Simulation
RSA algorithm and simulation using actors Alice, Bob and Charlie. This was a group project for our security and encryption course. It involved creating a RSA cryptosystem and simulating the Encryption, Decryption and Interception(Alice,Bob,Charlie). 

Please Ensure that if you are using your own P's and Q's that they are prime numbers bigger than 127.
